RetroShaderFix - https://github.com/EthanRDoesMC/RetroShaderFix

RetroShaderFix attempts to solves graphical issues with legacy versions of No Man's Sky and current graphics cards and drivers.

Versions supported: Release, Foundation, Path Finder, Atlas Rises.

The GUI will try and autodetect Steam and GOG No Man's Sky versions and will prompt the user if it is unable to detect the version, to do this it uses NMSVersionDll - https://github.com/qjimbo/NMSVersionDll

RetroShaderFix works by replacing the shader code of the game with versions fixed for your specific graphics card vendor (AMD or nvidia).

PAK files which contain the fixed Shader code are developed by EthanRDoesMC. This GUI program was developed by Qjimbo.
